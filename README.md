# Patient Treatment Analysis


## üìå Overview
This project analyzes patient treatment outcomes using different machine learning models to predict which treatments are most effective.  
The models implemented include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (best accuracy)

This project demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, machine learning, evaluation metrics, and visualization**.

##  Dataset
- File: `dataset2.csv`
- Contains patient treatment records with features such as age, treatment type, health indicators, and treatment outcome.
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling

‚ö†Ô∏è If the dataset is too large, you may replace it with a smaller sample or mention an external link.

##  Methods
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked distributions, correlations, and missing values
   - Visualized trends in treatment outcomes  

2. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest (achieved best performance)  

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion Matrix

## üìà Results
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy among tested models.  
- Analysis highlighted key patient features that strongly influence treatment success.
